# TODOs

- Edit Reward function
- Handle floor collision (how to do? do we have that information irl?)
- Add endeffector (in xmls as well as objects in post_init, and sensors)
- Do we need all observations, as in the pick.py example? Probably need to remove the info of all other objects in the env...
