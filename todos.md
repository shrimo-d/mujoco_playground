# TODOs

- Edit Reward function
- Add endeffector position to obs?
- Handle floor collision (how to do? do we have that information irl?)
- Add endeffector (in xmls as well as objects in post_init, and sensors) -> Endeffector specs: baseplate 60mm durchmesser, höhe insgesamt 70mm, anfang von box: 50mm, box size: 60mm x 10 mm x 20 mm
endeffector collision is in menagerie dir assets, but this is bad, i need to fix it
- Do we need all observations, as in the pick.py example? Probably need to remove the info of all other objects in the env...
